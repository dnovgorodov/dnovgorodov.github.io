|:--------------------|:----|:---------------|:-----|:--------|:-----|:-----|:----|:-----|
0.33 uF Ceramic Capacitor | 1 | 0.2750 | $0.2750 | KEMET | C0805F104K5RACTU | PRLTA 109 | N/A | U1 |
0.1 ÂµF Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package | 2 | 0.2750 | $0.55 | KEMET | C0805F104K5RACTU | PRLTA 109 | N/A | C2, C3 |

Note: Setting it up as a table is nice because it is completely viewable without scaling issues. <ins>Downside</ins> is that you have to do the math.

* You could also import your BOM via a screenshot of the spreadsheet created BOM
