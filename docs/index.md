# Introduction

This individual datasheet will cover details about my subsystem which will play a role in my team's larger project: the Smart Trash Can. My subsystem is the trash weight-sensing subsystem.

# Project Summary

The project that my team and I are working on is building a smart trash can. Our trash can combines features such as sensors to track the weight and height of the trash, alerting the user when either has been exceeded, motion sensors to allow the user to open the trash can without touching it, etc. The weight sensor will be at the bottom of the trash can with a pressure plate (just a surface) connected to it, so that the weight of the trash can be distributed evenly. The height sensor will likely be located underneath the lid and will only detect height when the trash can lid is closed, so that it does not pick up a person's presence and trigger a false positive. Finally, we will have an infrared (IR) motion sensor to detect when someone either waves or comes near the trash can, which will then send the signal to the motor which will open the trash can without the user ever having to touch it.

# My Contribution

As stated previously, I was responsible for designing the weight-tracking subsystem.
