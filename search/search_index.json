It includes built-in protection features such as thermal shutdown and short-circuit safety, making it a great choice for simple projects and educational use. | However, it is inefficient when the input voltage is much higher than 5 V, since the excess energy is dissipated as heat. It also typically requires a heatsink for high current applications and cannot supply more than about 1 A of current. | | **AMS1117-5.0** | ![AMS1117](https://mm.digikey.com/Volume0/opasdata/d220001/derivates/1/003/227/499/MFG_5272_AMS1117-5.0_primary_sml%28200x200%29.jpg) | [AMS1117-5.0 \u2013 SparkFun](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/evvo/AMS1117-5-0/24370130) \u2014 **\\)0.30 \u2013 \\(0.80 USD** | The AMS1117-5.0 is a compact low-dropout regulator that provides 5 V output with only about a 1.1 V difference required between input and output. It\u2019s inexpensive, simple to use, and suitable for space-constrained projects that don\u2019t need high current output. | Despite its small size, it suffers from poor heat dissipation and limited current handling (around 800 mA). It\u2019s also not very efficient when used with higher input voltages, and can overheat if pushed too hard. | | **LM2596** | ![LM2596](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/r6EAAOSww-1k6F9U/s-l1600.webp) | [LM2596 DC-DC Buck Converter Module](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm2596.pdf) \u2014 **\\)1.50 \u2013 $3.00 USD | The LM2596 is a highly efficient switching regulator that can provide up to 3 A of current with efficiency levels above 85%. It works well with a wide range of input voltages and is ideal for powering larger loads or battery-powered systems where efficiency is important. | On the downside, it produces more electrical noise than linear regulators, making it less suitable for sensitive analog circuits. It also requires more space and components, and its wiring is slightly more complex compared to simple linear regulators. |</p> <p>Optimal Choice: LM2596 DC-DC Buck Converter Module</p> <p>Rationale: The LM2596 was chosen as the optimal solution because it combines high efficiency with the ability to deliver more current (up to 3 A) while minimizing heat generation. Unlike linear regulators such as the LM7805 or AMS1117, it does not waste large amounts of energy as heat, making it ideal for systems powered by batteries or higher-voltage sources. Additionally, it supports a wide input voltage range, which provides flexibility for different power sources. While it produces more ripple than linear regulators, this can be managed with additional filtering if needed, and its overall efficiency and current capacity make it the best choice for most embedded projects.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>written context</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials-example-as-table","title":"Bill of Materials Example (as Table)","text":"<p>Table ##: An example of one approach to adding your BOM table to this section.</p> Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacture Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 8-bit SIPO/SISO Shift Register, SOIC-16 package 1 $0.49 $ 0.49 NXP 74HC595D,112 DigiKey datasheet link U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package 10 0.2750 $2.75 KEMET C0805F104K5RACTU PRLTA 109 n/a C2, C4, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C16 <p>Note: Setting it up as a table is nice because it is completely viewable without scaling issues.
