Our trash can combines features such as sensors to track the weight and height of the trash, alerting the user when either has been exceeded, motion sensors to allow the user to open the trash can without touching it, etc. The weight sensor will be at the bottom of the trash can with a pressure plate (just a surface) connected to it, so that the weight of the trash can be distributed evenly. The height sensor will likely be located underneath the lid and will only detect height when the trash can lid is closed, so that it does not pick up a person's presence and trigger a false positive. Finally, we will have an infrared (IR) motion sensor to detect when someone either waves or comes near the trash can, which will then send the signal to the motor which will open the trash can without the user ever having to touch it.</p>"},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<p>As stated previously, I was responsible for designing the weight-tracking subsystem.</p> <ul> <li>To view the block diagram, please visit this page: Block Diagram</li> <li>To view my component selection, please visit this page: Component Selection</li> <li>To view the schematic of my subsystem, please visit this page: Schematic</li> <li>To view my schematic's power budget, please visit this page: Power Budget</li> </ul>"},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/","title":"Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>My subsystem is fairly simple. For the power, it uses a barrel jack adaptor to provide 9V to the LM7805T voltage regulator which then powers the Curiosity Nano Board. For the weight system itself, my subsystem uses a 50kg load cell (a load cell, or weight sensor, that is able to detect up to 50kg of weight) which then sends its signal to a differential op-amp (as the signal from the load cell is in the millivolt range, whereas the Nano Board will need signals in the volt range to process). Afterwards, the analog signal is processed through an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and is then sent on to another subsystem.</p>"},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#block-diagram","title":"Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection","text":""},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>During my component selection process, I considered many factors: cost, use, effectiveness, accuracy, etc. For the load cell (or weight sensor), I chose the SparkFun 50kg Load Cell because of its impressive weight-detection capacity, accurate detection through ADC signaling, and relatively low cost. For the 5V voltage regulator, I chose the LM7805T due to my familiarity with it, ease-of-use, and once again, low cost. For the op-amp, I had originally chosen the AD620ANZ due to its accuracy and low offset voltage, but eventually decided to do with the INA333 due to its lower quiescent current and lower cost.</p>"},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#component-1-load-cell-weight-sensor","title":"Component 1 \u2014 Load Cell (Weight Sensor)","text":"Solution Photo Link &amp; Cost Pros Cons SparkFun Load Cell \u2013 50 kg (Generic) SparkFun Load Cell \u2013 50 kg (Generic) - $6.25 Accurate (\u00b10.02%), easy to mount, widely supported Off-center loads reduce accuracy 50kg Strain Gauge Phidgets Micro Load Cell (0\u201350 kg) - $6.99 High range, compact, reliable industrial supplier Seems to be a lot of wiring Velleman WPSE471 Load Cell + ADC Velleman Load Cell - $11.95 Comes with ADC and is designed to work with load cells Limited to 44 lbs; little more expensive than the other options <p>Optimal Choice: SparkFun Load Cell \u2013 50 kg (Generic)</p> <p>Rationale: Provides great range, linear response, easy integration with ADC, and low cost.</p>"},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#component-2-5v-voltage-regulator","title":"Component 2 \u2014 5V Voltage Regulator","text":"Solution Photo Link &amp; Cost Pros Cons LM7805T LM7805T - $0.55 - Robust and widely used - Built-in thermal &amp; short-circuit protection - High dropout ~2 V - Inefficient (wastes voltage as heat) AMS1117-5.0 AMS1117-5.0 - $0.12 - Lower dropout (around 1.1 V) - Very cheap &amp; compact (SMD) - Max ~1 A only - Can run hot at high load UA7805CKCS UA7805CKCS - $1.34 - Handles up to 1.5 A - Strong protection and reliability (classic 78xx design) - Still high dropout (around 2 V) - More expensive than AMS1117 <p>Optimal Choice: LM7805T</p> <p>Rationale: Offers fairly good stability; has pretty good current capacity; and is fairly reliable at a low cost.</p>"},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#component-3-operational-amplifier","title":"Component 3 \u2014 Operational Amplifier","text":"Solution Photo Link &amp; Cost Pros Cons MCP6004 MCP6004 - $0.59 - Low power consumption (100 \u00b5A typical)  - Rail-to-rail input/output  - Wide supply voltage range (1.8V to 6.0V) - High input offset voltage (~4.5 mV)  - Not suitable for low-level differential signals like load cells AD620ANZ AD620ANZ - $17.22 - Low input offset voltage (~50 \u00b5V)  - High common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR)  - Adjustable gain via external resistor - Higher cost  - Single-channel amplifier INA333 INA333 - $4.54 - Lower offset voltage (+/- 25 nanoAmps)  - Lower quiescent current (1mA)  - More cost effective - Lower maximum supply voltage  - Lower bandwidth <p>Optimal Choice: INA333</p> <p>Rationale: Low offset voltage; low quiescent current; lower cost than AD620ANZ.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":""},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This is the bill of materials for my trash weight-detection system.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacturer Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 0.33 uF Ceramic Capacitor 1 $0.2750 $0.2750 KEMET C0805F104K5RACTU PRLTA 109 N/A U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package 2 $0.2750 $0.55 KEMET C0805F104K5RACTU PRLTA 109 N/A C2, C3 Red LED 1 $0.26 $0.26 Kingbright WP7113SURDK Link Datasheet D1 Fuse 1 $1.2 $1.2 SCHURTER Inc. 0034.1506 Link Datasheet F1 Op-Amp 1 $4.54 $4.54 Texas Instruments INA333AIDGKR Link Datasheet INA333_DN1 Barrel Jack 1 $0.76 $0.76 Same Sky PJ-102AH Link Datasheet J1 2x4 Connector 1 $0.27 $0.27 Adam Tech BHR-08-VUA Link Datasheet J2 5V Voltage Regulator 1 $0.33 $0.33 TAEJIN LM7805T Link Datasheet LM7805_DN1 Load Cell 1 $6.25 $6.25 SparkFun Electronics SEN-10245 Link Datasheet LoadSensor_DN1 Curiosity Nano Board 1 $9.99 $9.99 Microchip Technology PIC18F57Q43 Link Datasheet PIC18F57Q43_DN1 1 kOhm 1/4 W Resistor 2 $0.1 $0.2 Stackpole Electronics Inc CFF14JT1K00 Link Datasheet R1, R2 100 Ohm 1 W Resistor 1 $0.22 $0.44 Stackpole Electronics Inc CF1JT100R Link Datasheet R3 Push Switch 1 $0.1 $0.1 Same Sky TS02-66-55-BK-260-LCR-D Link Datasheet SW1 Test Point 5 $0.39 $1.95 Keystone Electronics 5000 Link Datasheet TP1, TP2, TP3, TP4, TP5"},{"location":"04-Schematic/schematic/","title":"Schematic","text":""},{"location":"04-Schematic/schematic/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This schematic is designed to detect the weight of the trash in our smart trash can.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"04-Schematic/schematic/#resouces","title":"Resouces","text":"<p>The schematic as a PDF download is available here, and the Zip folder of the project here.</p>"},{"location":"05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/","title":"Power Budget","text":""},{"location":"05-Power-Budget/Power-Budget/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This is my power budget.
