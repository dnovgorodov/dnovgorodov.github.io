For the power, it uses a barrel jack adaptor to provide 9V to the LM7805T voltage regulator which then powers the Curiosity Nano Board. For the weight system itself, my subsystem uses a 50kg load cell (a load cell, or weight sensor, that is able to detect up to 50kg of weight) which then sends its signal to a differential op-amp (as the signal from the load cell is in the millivolt range, whereas the Nano Board will need signals in the volt range to process). Afterwards, the analog signal is processed through an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and is then sent on to another subsystem.</p>"},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#block-diagram","title":"Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection","text":""},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#component-1-load-cell-weight-sensor","title":"Component 1 \u2014 Load Cell (Weight Sensor)","text":"Solution Photo Link &amp; Cost Pros Cons SparkFun Load Cell \u2013 50 kg (Generic) SparkFun Load Cell \u2013 50 kg (Generic) \u2014 $6.25 Accurate (\u00b10.02%), easy to mount, widely supported Off-center loads reduce accuracy 50kg Strain Gauge Phidgets Micro Load Cell (0\u201350 kg) \u2014 $6.99 High range, compact, reliable industrial supplier Seems to be a lot of wiring Velleman WPSE471 Load Cell + ADC Velleman Load Cell \u2014 ~$11.95 per gauge + materials Comes with ADC and is designed to work with load cells Limited to 44 lbs; little more expensive than the other options <p>Optimal Choice: SparkFun Load Cell \u2013 50 kg (Generic) Rationale: Provides adequate range, linear response, easy integration with HX711 ADC, and low cost.</p>"},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#component-2-5v-voltage-regulator","title":"Component 2 \u2014 5V Voltage Regulator","text":"Solution Photo Link &amp; Cost Pros Cons LM7805 Texas Instruments LM7805 \u2013 Digi-Key \u2014 $0.50 \u2013 $1.00 USD The LM7805 is a very reliable and easy-to-use voltage regulator that provides a stable 5 V output with minimal external components. It includes built-in protection features such as thermal shutdown and short-circuit safety, making it a great choice for simple projects and educational use. However, it is inefficient when the input voltage is much higher than 5 V, since the excess energy is dissipated as heat. It also typically requires a heatsink for high current applications and cannot supply more than about 1 A of current. AMS1117-5.0 AMS1117-5.0 \u2013 SparkFun \u2014 $0.30 \u2013 $0.80 USD The AMS1117-5.0 is a compact low-dropout regulator that provides 5 V output with only about a 1.1 V difference required between input and output. It\u2019s inexpensive, simple to use, and suitable for space-constrained projects that don\u2019t need high current output. Despite its small size, it suffers from poor heat dissipation and limited current handling (around 800 mA). It\u2019s also not very efficient when used with higher input voltages, and can overheat if pushed too hard. LM2596 LM2596 DC-DC Buck Converter Module \u2014 $1.50 \u2013 $3.00 USD The LM2596 is a highly efficient switching regulator that can provide up to 3 A of current with efficiency levels above 85%. It works well with a wide range of input voltages and is ideal for powering larger loads or battery-powered systems where efficiency is important. On the downside, it produces more electrical noise than linear regulators, making it less suitable for sensitive analog circuits. It also requires more space and components, and its wiring is slightly more complex compared to simple linear regulators. <p>Optimal Choice: LM2596 DC-DC Buck Converter Module</p> <p>Rationale: The LM2596 was chosen as the optimal solution because it combines high efficiency with the ability to deliver more current (up to 3 A) while minimizing heat generation. Unlike linear regulators such as the LM7805 or AMS1117, it does not waste large amounts of energy as heat, making it ideal for systems powered by batteries or higher-voltage sources. Additionally, it supports a wide input voltage range, which provides flexibility for different power sources. While it produces more ripple than linear regulators, this can be managed with additional filtering if needed, and its overall efficiency and current capacity make it the best choice for most embedded projects.</p>"},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#component-3-operational-amplifier","title":"Component 3 \u2014 Operational Amplifier","text":"Solution Photo Link &amp; Cost Pros Cons MCP6004 MCP6004 - $0.59 - Low power consumption (100 \u00b5A typical)  - Rail-to-rail input/output  - Wide supply voltage range (1.8V to 6.0V) - High input offset voltage (~4.5 mV)  - Not suitable for low-level differential signals like load cells AD620 AD620ANZ - $17.22 - Low input offset voltage (~50 \u00b5V)  - High common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR)  - Adjustable gain via external resistor - Higher cost  - Single-channel amplifier INA125 INA125 - $4.00 - Integrated bridge excitation  - Low input offset voltage  - High CMRR  - Single-channel amplifier - Slightly higher cost  - Less manual control over reference voltage <p>Optimal Choice: AD620ANZ</p> <p>Rationale: Low offset voltage; more free-range control over reference voltage.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>written context</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials-example-as-table","title":"Bill of Materials Example (as Table)","text":"<p>Table ##: An example of one approach to adding your BOM table to this section.</p> Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacture Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 8-bit SIPO/SISO Shift Register, SOIC-16 package 1 $0.49 $ 0.49 NXP 74HC595D,112 DigiKey datasheet link U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package 10 0.2750 $2.75 KEMET C0805F104K5RACTU PRLTA 109 n/a C2, C4, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C16 <p>Note: Setting it up as a table is nice because it is completely viewable without scaling issues.
